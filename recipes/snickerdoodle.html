                What sets a snickerdoodle cookie apart from the rest? 
                Cinnamon sugar. These scrumptious treats are rolled in cinnamon sugar before being 
                popped in the oven.

            <li>2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                    Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Make cookies: Beat together white sugar, butter, and eggs in a large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. 
                    Combine flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl; stir into creamed butter mixture until dough holds together.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Form dough into balls (about 2 teaspoons in each ball), then roll in cinnamon-sugar coating. 
                    Place dough balls about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven on the center rack for 7 minutes. 
                    Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
